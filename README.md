<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Matthew!</h1>

<p align="left">I am a Full-Stack Developer who is mostly self-taught using resources like StackOverflow, Youtube, W3Schools, and freecodecamp. Now I am pursuing my bachelor's degree with a major in Computer Science.</p>

<br>

<p align="center">I have experience with Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL</p>

<br>

<p align="center">In my free time I like to study Astronomy and Astrophysics. My new telescope should be coming soon which I will finally be able to do some astrophotography which I plan on incorporating into some projects. I am always trying to grow my skills by trying new things or reading new books as well when I have time.</p>
