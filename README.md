<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm Matthew!</h1>

<p align="left">Since I was a child I was always fascinated with technology and my love for it grew extensively when I took my first computer class in middle school. In high school I took as many computer classes that I could learning things like HTML and Java. Ever since I have been mostly self-taught using resources like W3Schools and freecodecamp. Now I am pursuing my first bachelor's with a major in Computer Science.</p>

<br>

<p align="center">I have experience with Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL</p>
<p align="center">I am currently improving on my Python and SQL.</p>
<p align="center">I plan on learning as many different languages as I can while focusing on the tech stack I need to focus on to complete a function or project.</p>

<br>

<p align="center">In my free time I like to study Astronomy and Astrophysics. My new telescope should be coming soon which I will finally be able to do some astrophotography which I plan on incorporating into some projects. I am always trying to grow my skills by trying new things or reading new books as well when I have time.</p>
